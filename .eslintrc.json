  * Next.js recommends using ESLint to lint your code.

  * https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/eslint
  *In the above small code example we have added a few additional defaults, we have said that React will always be defined even if we don't specifically import it, and I have added a personal custom rule that I like which allows you to prefix variables with an underscore _ if you have declared them but not used them in the code.
